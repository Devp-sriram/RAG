I. MISSION
II. OVERVIEW
The Ambrics C-Corp Employee Handbook (the “Handbook”) has been
developed to provide general guidelines about Ambrics policies and
procedures for employees.  It is a guide to assist you in becoming familiar with some of the
privileges and obligations of your employment, including Ambricsʹs policy
of voluntary at‐will employment.  None of the policies or guidelines in the Handbook are
intended to give rise to contractual rights or obligations, or to be construed as a guarantee of
employment for any specific period of time, or any specific type of work.  Additionally, with the
exception of the voluntary at‐will employment policy, these guidelines are subject to
modification, amendment or revocation by Ambrics at any time, without
advance notice.
